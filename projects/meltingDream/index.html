    <p>This short game inspired by 'Five Nights at Freddy's' was built to work with a custom Makey Makey controller built to resemble the console in the game.</p>
    <p>However, in this archive of the project online you evidently won't have one. Please refer to these alternate keyboard controls.</p>
    <p>Keyboard Controls: Doors on Left Right and Up arrows, Spacebar for Cameras, W & A for changing cameras, S DFG for colors</p>
    <p>MakeyMakey Controls: Doors are controlled by the top three blue buttons. Cameras are controlled by the red and bottom two blue buttons.</p>
